The groups member who worked on this project are: Ethan Groen and Jordan Sinclair

With agrrement from both parties the work was divided as follows: 

Ethan did requirements: 1-2, 4-6  (cases: a, b, d, e, f)
Jordan did requirements: 3 , 7 and 9-10		(cases: c, g), plus saving and loading

The work was divided in this way becaause Ethan was uncomfortable doing the saving and loading, so he requested not to.
Then all the requirements that he handled were pretty similar or all wokred 
off the same few principals and would be easy to do as a group. 
So he offered to to them all to make up for the fact that he asked Jordan to do the saving and loading.
